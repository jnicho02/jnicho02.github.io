I had a fine old time last weekend in sunny(ish) Berlin with the WhereCampers. I did another talk about <a href="http://openplaques.org">Open Plaques</a> but didn't get many punters as it was quite difficult to escape the gravitational pull of the main hall (..or people weren't interested).
One of the hot topics was producing better POI data, with talks from both Google and Yahoo! I'm seeing this myself with producing reports for Europe in that much of current POI data can be traced back toi NavTec and from there probably back to one of the 'yellow books' services. With the rise of the web, the yellow books have become far less important to businesses and I believe have struggled to produce relevant data any more. Google were looking at mining web sites for better info. Yahoo! were investigating mining Flickr photos and tags. Both companies are interested in finding up-to-date POIs and also in using colloquial terms that the real users call them.
There was plenty of talk about open data and some discussion of copyright.
Another popular topic was data visualisation with some inspiring visuals from @oobr
There was a lot more, but i've got work to do now so must go. On the whole, my gut feel was that anything geo is on the way up.
