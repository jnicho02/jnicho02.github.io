<p>I was just trying to switch a Rails app over to mysql and had a bad time with the mysql gem. In the end I decided to get the data into sqlite3 instead. It wasn't too hard. I loaded the sql dump that I had been given into mysql then dumped it out again in a sqlite-friendly format with:</p>

<pre><code>mysqldump openplaques -u root -p --skip-add-drop-table --skip-extended-insert --no-create-info --skip-add-locks &gt; sqlite3_friendly.sql
</code></pre>

<p>sqlite expects apostrophes in inserts to be doubled '' rather tahn slashed, so I did a replace in a text editor. Maybe this could be set as a mysqldump param, but I couldn't find it.</p>

<p>Then it's a case of going into sqlite and</p>

<pre><code>.read sqlite3_friendly.sql
</code></pre>
