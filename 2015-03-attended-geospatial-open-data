<p>​​​​This evening event was held at <a href="https://www.campus.co/london/en">Google Campus London</a>. The talks weren't quite up-to-scratch, but there were some interesting bits. I particularly liked <a href="http://rawkes.com/">Robin Hawkes</a> talk about <a href="http://vizicities.com/">Vizicities</a> which presents a 3D view of OpenStreetMap.</p>
