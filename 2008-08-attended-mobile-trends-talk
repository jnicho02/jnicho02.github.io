<p>I went to a talk about the latest trends in mobile gaming.</p>

<h2 id="great-animation">Great Animation</h2>
<p>The latest trend is for big bold characters, large enough to be bold rather than shrunk to fit lots onto the screen.</p>

<h2 id="cheeky-touches">Cheeky touches.</h2>

<h2 id="different-palettes">Different Palettes</h2>
<p>The limitations of mobile have in effect freed designers from the console's shades-of-grey reality. Stark monochrome with flashes of colour can be effective in displaying characters.</p>

<h2 id="stick-figures">Stick Figures</h2>
<p>Similarly, characters do not need to be realistically rendered. Stick figures made out of circles can be good. E.g. Xiao Xiao</p>

<h2 id="star-ratings">Star Ratings</h2>
<p>A 5-star rating for a level taking account of speed, accuracy, etc. can make for a replayable game. Levels can be easy to complete, so as not to put off casual gamers, but hard to master. There needs to be a reward for achieving 5 stars.</p>

<h2 id="unlockable-modes">Unlockable Modes</h2>
<p>Retro Chop Em Ups
e.g. Tetris Pop</p>

<p>e.g. Namco Arcade Golf: after finishing a hole, the player can play pacman for 30 seconds to earn a reward.</p>

<h2 id="cool-physics">Cool Physics</h2>
<p>e.g. Sola Rola, Gish, Enigmo.</p>

<h2 id="sandboxes">Sandboxes</h2>
<p>freeplay with no game target</p>

<h2 id="genre-mashups">Genre Mashups</h2>
<p>Including a traditional game (like a card game) as part of the game mechanic. People will already know how to play and remember the 'brand' e.g. Puzzle Quest, Creatures of the Deep.</p>

<h2 id="contextual-controls">Contextual Controls</h2>
<p>Using a single button that changes purpose depending on the current situation. e.g. Pro Evolution Soccer mobile.</p>

<h2 id="pigs">Pigs</h2>
<p>Well, 'fun' anyway. e.g. Piglympics. You know what you're getting just by the name: pigs, doing olympic sports.</p>

<h2 id="asynchronous-multiplayer">Asynchronous Multiplayer</h2>
<p>Turn-based spread out over time. E.g. Spore Origins, Anytime Pool for FaceBook.</p>

<h2 id="simple-buttons-complex-movements">Simple Buttons, Complex Movements</h2>
<p>A single button to control what happens, but has to be pressed at just the right time. e.g. Kimikaze Robots.</p>

<h2 id="motion-puzzlers">Motion Puzzlers</h2>
<p>Using the tilt detection powers of the device e.g. stuff on the iPhone</p>

<h2 id="touchscreen-only-controls">Touchscreen Only Controls</h2>
<p>e.g. The iPhone. Lots of lessons can be learn from the DS Lite</p>

<h2 id="whack-a-mole-control">Whack-a-mole Control</h2>
<p>The screen real estate is divided into 9 and the keypad buttons correspond to that sector to control where you fire a gun at say. With a bit of thought, this can be made interesting.</p>

<h2 id="level-editors">Level Editors</h2>
<p>Create and share. Remember the 'YouTube rule' that 2% of people are creators and 98% of people are consumers. E.g. Boom Blox</p>

<h2 id="pre-rendered-3d">Pre-rendered 3D</h2>
<p>Playing the game on top of a photorealistic background. e.g. Table Tennis Star. This can look great and really stand out from the crowd as long as the gameplay is good.</p>

<h2 id="friend-rankings">Friend Rankings</h2>
<p>The league table should be of people that you know, not the whole world.</p>

<h2 id="achievementsfeats">Achievements/Feats</h2>
