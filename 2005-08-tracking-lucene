<p>After reading an article on developer.com about <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a> I was fairly excited. This looks like another killer technology, especially if it could be integrated quickly and easily into systems. I'm keen on <a href="http://hibernate.org/orm/">Hibernate</a>, Spring and AppFuse so when I saw code_poet's entry about a Simple Hibenate Search Engine I'm interested in adding it to AppFuse as a configurable service.</p>

<p>Reading further in the AppFuse wiki I found this article about Lucene AppFuse integration</p>
