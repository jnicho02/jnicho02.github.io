      <h1>Fun at Brighton Hack Day</h1>
      <p>​​​​Well, as the title says, I had a bit of fun this weekend at the inaugoral Brighton Hack Farm.</p>

<p>The plan was fairly simple: turn up at 10am, spend the day hacking together some code, demo at 5pm. Implementation of the plan was slightly trickier, but ultimately successful.</p>

<p>I went along as part of the Brighton Coding Dojo group. We convened at 10(ish) and decided on a SCRUM-based effort. Thom had brought a box of sensors with him and after a quikc brainstorm I put foward the idea of an Inform text adventure interacting with from the physical world.</p>

<p>The team split into pairs to investigate the different sections of the project and reconvened every 1/2 hour or so. On the whole this worked extremely (no pun intended) well as it meant that we could attack the problem on multiple fronts. The main problem that I had was in finding the right syntax to use in Inform.</p>

<p>Around lunchtime we were joined by Mr Hopper Snr, who after hearing a little about the plan jumped in to story writing for the text adventure. I was focussed on producing a single simplest interaction to prove that the system would work, whereas Simon was interested in the story as a whole (i.e. start with the solution and work backwards). I split this off to be a separate activity and it worked well as it is easy to end up with a really lame text adventure if you focus on getting the mechanism working.</p>

<p>We nearly had an integration problem where an incomplete command would be issued to the game. This was because we didn't force a test.</p>

<p>The eventual demo worked a treat. Thom had adapted the temperature sensor at the last minute to be embedded in the bottom of a cut off Coke can. Hot or cold liquid could be poured into this and be in direct contact with the sensor. This would post a message to a web server which the demo laptop was polling. The Java Robot API was then used to write the appropriate command into the Inform game window at the prompt.</p>
