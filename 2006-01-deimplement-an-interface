<p>Maybe someone will tell me that i'm being really stupid, but is it possible to stop a class from being Serializable?</p>

<p>The reason I ask, is because java.awt.Component implements Serializable which means that all my Swing components are. Eclipse warns me that I haven't set up a static serialVersionUID which I do want to do for my model classes, that I really want to be serializable. So, is it possible to de-implement an interface? or is there an underlying reason that awt Components need to be serializable?</p>

<p>In connection with this thought i've been reading up on serialVersionUID. Here are some resources that might be useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Java Forums: To serialVersionUID or Not To serialVersionUID?</li>
  <li>The Squizlog: Eclipse 3.1, RAD 6.0 and serialVersionUID</li>
  <li>There is no performance gain from specifying a serialVersionUID. JavaWorld: Into the mist of serialization myths</li>
</ul>
