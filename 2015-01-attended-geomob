<p>​Last night I went to the first Geomob of 2105 http://geomobldn.org/post/102358677210/first-geomob-of-2015-13th-january-back-at-ucl​</p>

<p>​​There was a strong attendance including Ed Freyfogle, Steven Feldman​​, Gary Gale, ​Giussepe Sollazzo, ​Harry Wood, Angharad Stone….These are all people you should try to bump into at a geo event as they've got lots of experience and connections with past and present geo world.</p>

<p>There were 6 talks. Higlights being:</p>
