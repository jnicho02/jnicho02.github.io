      <h1>read "The 4 Disciplines of Execution" by Sean Covey</h1>
      <p>I just finished reading The 4 Disciplines of Execution, a book all about setting and achieving goals outside of 'the whirlwind'.</p>

<p>Good term that, 'the whirlwind', meaning the seeming neverending whirl of daily activities. How do you find time to do something over-and-above simply processing daily tasks and actually do something that moves forward?</p>

<p>The authors suggest:</p>

<h1 id="discipline-1-focus-on-the-wildly-important">Discipline 1: Focus on the wildly important</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>pick the single most important thing your group should achieve</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>say how you know you've crossed the finishing line</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="discipline-2-act-on-the-lead-measures">Discipline 2: Act on the Lead Measures</h1>

<ul>
  <li>think about cause-and-effect. The end goal is measured after the event, they call this a 'lag' measure. Try to identify simple day-to-day measurable things that you think have the ability to affect the end goal.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="discipline-3-keep-a-compelling-scoreboard">Discipline 3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard</h1>

<ul>
  <li>display the 'score' on the wall so that everyone can see whether we are winning</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="discipline-4-create-a-cadence-of-accountability">Discipline 4: Create a Cadence of Accountability</h1>

<ul>
  <li>meet every week for individuals to state what they have done last week and will do this week to move the lead measure.</li>
</ul>

<p>This fits in very well with Agile where we are used to measuring and acting on it, e.g. Discipline 2 reminds me of burndown charts and finishing sprints -&gt; better planning, less stress, better flow. Discipline 3 of Kanban charts on walls. Discipline 4 of daily standups.</p>

<p>I have found that Agile can get hyper focussed on delivering product efficiently (which isn't a bad thing!). 4 Disciplines adds strategy to Agile.</p>
