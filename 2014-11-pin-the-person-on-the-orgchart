<p>​For the company annual review I had to do a presentation to all the Brighton staff. I wanted to make a point to them that everyone in Argyll is now part of the larger mothership known as Landmark. So, I made a little game.</p>

<p>Now, how many of you know absolutely everybody in Landmark? All the new starters, everyone in Godalming?, Brighton? Here is what I did:</p>

<ol>
  <li>printed out the org chart and arranged it on a wall. It took a bit of shuffling around and blutack.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>printed out a list of names and job titles from a selection of people. Cut them into paper strips and put them in a hat​</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>passed the hat round and got everyone to pick one</li>
  <li>got them all on their feet at the same time to go and stick the name in the right place on the chart. Asking other people was allowed.</li>
</ol>

<p>They all seemed to really enjoy it, and I think that it was educational.</p>
