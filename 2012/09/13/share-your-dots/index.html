<p>Been reading this great book, Steal Like An Artist by Austin Kleon. Very inspiring. The things he says are very relevant to any creative endeavour, in my case developing code. So I'm going to steal a snippet which could just as easily be about encouraging companies to share on the web..</p>

<ul>
  <li>"Share your dots, but don't connect them."</li>
  <li>"Learn to code. Figure out how to make a website. Figure out blogging. Figure out Twitter and social media and all that other stuff. Find people on the Internet who love the same things as you and connect with them. Share things with them."</li>
  <li>"You don't have to share everything - in fact, sometimes it's much better if you don't. Show just a little bit of what you're working on. Share a sketch or a doodle or a snippet. Share a little glimpse of your process. Think about what you have to share that could be of some value to people. Share a handy tip you've discovered while working. Or a link to an interesting article. Mention a good book you're reading."</li>
  <li>"If you're worried about giving your secrets away, you can share your dots without connecting them. It's your finger that has to hit the publish button. You have control over what you share and how much you reveal."</li>
  <li>Austin Kleon</li>
</ul>
