<p>I've been reading "Man, Play and Games" by Roger Caillois and saw this list of the qualities of a game:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The need to prove one's superiority</li>
  <li>The desire to challenge, make a record, or merely overcome an obstacle</li>
  <li>The hope for and the pursuit of the favour of destiny</li>
  <li>Pleasure in secrecy, make-believe, or disguise</li>
  <li>Fear or inspiring of fear</li>
  <li>The search for repetition or symmetry, or in contrast, the joy of improvising, inventing, or infinitely varying solutions</li>
  <li>Solving a mystery or riddle</li>
  <li>The satisfaction procured from all arts involving contrivance</li>
  <li>The desire to test one's strength, skill, speed, endurance, equilibrium, or ingenuity</li>
  <li>Conformity to rules and laws, the duty to respect them, and the temptation to circumvent them</li>
  <li>And lastly, the intoxication, longing for ecstasy, and desire for voluptuous panic</li>
</ul>

<p>Caillois splits games into three partitions (or combinations of them): Agon (competition); Alea (chance); Mimicry (simulation); Ilinx (vertigo).</p>

<p>What I find interesting is that these were written in 1958 and they are still applicable. I have found the book good so far for analysing what and why people play online.</p>
