<p>​​​​Another train journey, another book (well, mini-book really). This time it was a guide to roles in Product Management​, available as a pdf at http://mediafiles.pragmaticmarketing.com/strategic-role-of-product-management/strategic_role_product_management.pdf​</p>

<p>I particularly liked The Pragmatic Marketing Framework on page 3 which I might print out and stick on the wall. They split all the areas involved in managing a product from conceiving ideas to event support. This chart of activities can be split nicely between three Product Management roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Product Strategy Director: balancing a product portfolio; setting prices; understanding the market​; etc.</li>
  <li>Technical Product Manager: innovation; product roadmap; use scenarios; etc.</li>
  <li>Product Marketing Manager: launch plans; sales tools; event support; etc.</li>
</ul>
