<p>​​​​<a href="http://www.monbiot.com/">George Monbiot</a> is a big noise on The Guardian with his slightly controversial, but very sensible, thoughts on nature and its effect on flooding. This book is really a collection of essays on rewilding and is far more a personal diary than I thought it would be.</p>
