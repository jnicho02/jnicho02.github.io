<p>​​​Principally a book about advertising, this book is still extremely relevant to User Experience and User Centred Design thinking. It is also pretty inspiring to.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, as it is written by an ace advertiser, the format of the book is big bold statements in large type plus some more in-depth articles.</p>

<p>I read it through twice and will no doubt read it again until it all sinks in.</p>
