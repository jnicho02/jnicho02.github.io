      <p>Despite being put "at risk" of redundancy last week, which will almost certainly end in actual redundancy next month I have decided to carry on as usual with any activities and events that attend. Today I went up to London to attend MeasurementCamp for the second time.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-measurementcamp">What is MeasurementCamp?</h1>
<p>Well, first off, it isn't actually a "Camp" in the commonly used sense of the word, e.g. "BarCamp", but it started from a Camp event and involves participation from all the attendees, i.e. it isn't a presentation that people attend, listen, then go away again. It is a workshop where we discuss how, practically, we can measure the effectiveness of various social media (Twitter, FaceBook Apps, blogging, etc.). I think that I rambled about this previously, but basically this matters to anyone in the I.T. Systems Supply chain, be they the person who wants to commission some work, a consultant, or the techie who wants to build some exciting Web 2.0 features. There is a school of management thought that says, "if you can't measure it, you can't manage it". Accepting that some people have gone ahead with features on a leap of faith and suceeded (Twitter, FaceBook…err, all the social networking features that we might choose to use) if we can't measure whether it works then the people in Management who control the purse strings will not be convinced to part with the cash, that is if they even understand what we are proposing in the first place.</p>

<p>Something has to be done…</p>

<p>Someone needs to work out some best practice…</p>

<p>That 'someone' might as well be us.</p>

<p>Eating our own dogfood
I suggested at this month's meeting that we track the spread of the MeasurementCamp meme and see if we can 'eat our own dogfood'. What is starting to emerge are three-fold</p>

<p>A rough methodology for specifying the goals, methods and measurements of a social networking campaign
A number of metrics + methods to generate the metrics
A number of commonly used techniques for different situations
The latter of these points is starting to look like an ideal case for creating Design Patterns, e.g. pattern: encourage personal Twittering for all staff, situation: where you trust all staff and are prepared to accept some loss of control. I will introduce the idea via the wiki.</p>
