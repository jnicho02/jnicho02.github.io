<p>​​​After seeing it mentioned in a Microservices article I took a look at <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html">Apache Kafka</a></p>

<p>Kafka was originally built by LinkedIn and then hived off to make a new company called Confluent. It is intended for processing of real-time data (such as web site tracking).</p>

<p>This <a href="http://blog.confluent.io/2015/02/25/stream-data-platform-1/%E2%80%8B">article from Confluent</a> helps.</p>

<p>One of the features of a microservices platform is that datastores are local to applications, i.e. they <em>do not</em> use a large centralised database. Some activities such as exploring logs, real-time analytics, will require data from lots of places to be piped to their own datastores, In a lossless, non-disruptive way. e.g. you don't want your e-commerce web site to run slowly because the web tracking is slowing it down.</p>

<p>This can happen particularly when the services aren't located geographically near to each other.</p>

<p>The idea is that everything can write to activity/log streams that can then be processed by Kafka as generic messages. This leaves you with a central pipeline.</p>
