      <h1>declaring log4j loggers statically....or not?</h1>
      <p>Logging is undeniably extremely useful, but I haven't quite worked out which strategy to use for creating loggers yet.</p>

<p>I've seen:</p>

<pre><code>protected final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(getClass());
</code></pre>

<p>used in AppFuse, which I assume means that you don't need to override in for subclasses. However, you can't log messages in static methods, as the logger is non-static.</p>

<p>In other systems I have declared a static logger:</p>

<pre><code>protected static Log log = LogFactory.getLog(Grid.class);
</code></pre>

<p>and then overridden it in subclasses uses a static initializer (hurrah! I found a use for static initializers!)</p>

<pre><code>static { log = LogFactory.getLog(DateGrid.class); }
</code></pre>

<p>I guess that the first way is useful because you don't need to keep stating the class, but unless there's a good reason why (please comment….) then the static version is more helpful…or have I made a mistake somewhere?</p>

<p>Update (20th July 2006)
Thanks for all the comments. I realised that my whole static initialiser malarky was cobblers as of course it would make logging statements from Grid look like they came from DateGrid. I've settled on declaring a log object in each and every class file, but i am using the abstract commons.logging classes and not the specific log4j just to be pedantic</p>

<pre><code>private static final org.apache.commons.logging.Log log = org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory.getLog($CLASS_NAME$.class);
</code></pre>

<p>Which will be transient by definition as it is static.</p>
