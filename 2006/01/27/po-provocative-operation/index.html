      <h1>Po = Provocative Operation</h1>
      <p>Sometimes good ideas come about by being deliberately provocative, not by trying to solve the problem directly. Thinking is a skill that we should all work on as one of the arsenal of technical skills needed in IT.</p>

<p>I've been reading Edward De Bono's Thinking Course. He introduces a term 'po' which could stand for 'provocative operation' or be part of hypothesis, suppose, possible or poetry. By stating a seemingly absurd standpoint, you might produce the unusual solution that cracks the problem.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A reversal</li>
  <li>Exaggeration</li>
  <li>Distortion</li>
  <li>Wishful thinking
It made me think particularly about the web…How about taking a reasonable statement about how data is stored: "Data is stored in a central store called a database. It is held in a structured format and indexed for speed. Data is normalised so that a piece of information is unique and 'correct'." and completely reversing it: "Data is distributed widely as single nodes of information. It is held in an unstructured format and only the local index knows where it is. A piece of information may appear in numerous places having the same or different meaning depending upon the opinion of the author.". et viola, you've just described the internet.</li>
</ul>

<p>People at FreeServe applied this to pricing of dial-up web access in the UK. Everyone was charging £25/month and then they came in and gave it away for free.</p>

<p>How about?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Every citizen should be given their own, free, web site…</li>
  <li>Petrol should be given away free of charge….</li>
  <li>Parents should go to school with their kids…</li>
  <li>Kids should teach at school…</li>
  <li>The day should be divided in 20 hours…</li>
</ul>
