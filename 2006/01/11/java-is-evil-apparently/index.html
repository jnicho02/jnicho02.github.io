      <h1>OpenOffice.org 2.0 uses some Java. This is evil apparently...</h1>
      <p>I was pleased to see that OpenOffice.org 2.0 now has a database and that that database is HSQL. This seems a practical choice as the feature was badly lacking and is good value for the limited resources available. It does mean that this feature and a couple of others require Java. Whilst doing a bit of searching I found this article on NewsForge and was stunned by the venom that some of the FOSS community has against Java.</p>

<p>I hadn't realised how strongly some people feel that all software should be 100% free and open source. Personally I regarded Java as 'free' in that it is free to use…but apparently i'm wrong and it is the devil incarnate. I am trying to understand the comment posters views, but it feels almost like a holy war. The issue is one of black and white….one commenter joked "Better never use the Windows version of OO.org…because that version requires a (gasp) proprietary OS. What sacrilege!" but this was still greeted by fundamentalism</p>

<p>I will try to keep an open mind.</p>
