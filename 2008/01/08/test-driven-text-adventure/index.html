      <h1>Test Driven Text adventure development</h1>
      <p>To continue my investigations into text adventure programming using Inform7 I have been thinking about different types of puzzles. I was browsing through a Game Design book in Borders which included a short paragraph on puzzle types. If I remember rightly, the list is as below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ordinary use of an object: use something for it's normal purpose</li>
  <li>extraordinary use of an object: use something in a way that it wasn't originally intended</li>
  <li>in-the-middle: erm…i'll fill this in later when I remember what it is!</li>
  <li>chain of events: A causes B, elsewhere in the game C causes D, player summises that B will cause C so that A –&gt; D</li>
  <li>timing: performing an action before or after a specific event</li>
  <li>preparing the way: do something so that when another event occurs then it has a different result</li>
  <li>fabrication: make something out of a number of objects</li>
  <li>dialogue: by leading the conversation down a particular path, the solution is reached</li>
  <li>people: by understanding character's unique personalities the player can use them to achieve a desired action</li>
  <li>cryptogram / word: an anagram, hidden word, play on meaning (like a crossword clue)</li>
  <li>riddle: a classic riddle puzzle</li>
  <li>classic: a puzzle historically used in text adventures</li>
</ul>

<p>I would like to write an example of each type of puzzle in Inform in order to learn how it works</p>

<h2 id="ordinary-use-of-an-object-opening-a-bottle-of-wine">Ordinary use of an object: Opening a bottle of wine</h2>
<p>My first attempt is to code opening a bottle of wine.
###Iteration 1: Give it a title and write a test</p>

<pre><code>"Opening some wine" by Jez Nicholson
Test wine with "open bottle" holding the wine.
</code></pre>

<p>This will fail to compile as Inform doesn't know what the wine is. This is fixed by introducing a room with a bottle of wine in:</p>

<pre><code>"Opening some wine" by Jez Nicholson
Test wine with "open bottle" holding the wine.
The lounge is a room.
The bottle of wine is in the lounge.
</code></pre>

<p>This will now compile, but the test will result in nothing happening</p>

<pre><code>lounge
You can see a bottle of wine (empty) here.
test wine
(first acquiring the bottle of wine)
(Testing.)
[1] open bottle
That's not something you can open.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="iteration-2-make-the-bottle-into-something-that-is-openable">Iteration 2: Make the bottle into something that is openable</h3>

<pre><code>"Opening some wine" by Jez Nicholson
Test wine with "open bottle" holding the wine.
The lounge is a room.
The bottle of wine is in the lounge. The bottle of wine is an openable container.
</code></pre>

<p>results in:</p>

<pre><code>lounge
You can see a bottle of wine (empty) here.
test wine
(first acquiring the bottle of wine)
(Testing.)
[1] open bottle
That's already open.
The bottle appears to be already open.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="iteration-3-the-bottle-should-be-closed">Iteration 3: The bottle should be closed</h3>

<pre><code>"Opening some wine" by Jez Nicholson
Test wine with "open bottle" holding the wine.
The lounge is a room.
The bottle of wine is a closed openable container in the lounge.
</code></pre>

<p>results in:</p>

<pre><code>lounge
You can see a bottle of wine (closed) here.
test wine
(first acquiring the bottle of wine)
(Testing.)
[1] open bottle
You open the bottle of wine.
</code></pre>

<p>But, it shouldn't be that easy, you should use a corkscrew</p>

<h3 id="iteration-4-lock-the-bottle">Iteration 4: Lock the bottle</h3>

<pre><code>The bottle of wine is a closed openable locked container in the lounge.
</code></pre>

<p>Gives:</p>

<pre><code>lounge
You can see a bottle of wine (closed) here.
test wine
(first acquiring the bottle of wine)
(Testing.)
[1] open bottle
It seems to be locked
</code></pre>

<h3 id="iteration-5-introduce-a-corkscrew">Iteration 5: Introduce a corkscrew</h3>

<pre><code>The corkscrew is in the lounge.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="iteration-6-use-the-corkscrew-to-open-the-bottle">Iteration 6: Use the corkscrew to open the bottle</h3>

<pre><code>"Opening some wine" by Jez Nicholson
Test wine with "take corkscrew / unlock bottle with the corkscrew / open bottle" holding the wine.
The lounge is a room.
The bottle of wine is a closed openable locked container in the lounge.
The corkscrew is in the lounge.
The corkscrew unlocks the wine bottle.
</code></pre>

<p>results in:</p>

<pre><code>lounge
You can see a bottle of wine (closed) and a corkscrew here.
test wine
(first acquiring the bottle of wine)
(Testing.)
[1] take corkscrew
Taken.
[2] unlock bottle with the corkscrew
You unlock the bottle of wine.
[3] open bottle
You open the bottle of wine.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="iteration-7-make-the-english-more-natural">Iteration 7: Make the English more natural</h3>
<p>rather than unlocking the bottle, then opening it, it is more natural to just 'open the bottle with the corkscrew'</p>

<p>Test wine with "take corkscrew / open bottle with the corkscrew" holding the wine.</p>
