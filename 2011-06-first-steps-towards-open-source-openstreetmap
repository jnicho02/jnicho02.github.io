<p>I'm working with some European data at the moment, part of which is POI data for "nearest hospital", "nearest educational facility", etc. and the data is quite poor. I suspect that it originally sourced from NavTec and hence "Yellow Books". I also suspect that the data in OpenStreetMap will be orders of magnitude more accurate.</p>

<p>My first port of call was to examine the attributes used in OSM. To do this I download an area of central Dublin into JOSM and look at the raw data. Taking hospitals as an example I can quickly see that these are encoded in three different ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As point data with an attributes of "amenity=hospital" and "name=foo"</li>
  <li>As an area, again marked "amenity=hospital" and "name=foo"</li>
  <li>As a building, which is an area also marked with "building=hospital". Hospital buildings are often placed within a hospital area, but not necessarily.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've then taken a look at <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite">SpatiaLite</a> which is a really lightweight file-based database server. This would be great for packaging with an app, but is also good for quick experiments. I may need to go up to PostGIS if it isn't up to the job.</p>

<p>I downloaded the spatialite-gui binary for Windows, unzipped it and ran it.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://download.geofabrik.de/osm/europe/">GeoFabrik</a> I downloaded <a href="http://download.geofabrik.de/osm/europe/ireland.shp.zip">ireland.shp.zip</a></p>

<p>In the SpatialLite GUI I created a new database and then went to "Load Shapefile", I picked a .shp file from my downloaded data and set the SRID to 4326 (which is the id in the spatial_ref_sys table for WGS-84) and the charset to UTF-8. It then imported in a matter of seconds. This gave me a sql table that I could query using extra functions such as Distance()</p>

<p>I got a WGS-84 lat/lon for my search point by right-clicking on Google Maps and doing a "Drop LatLng Marker" (I can't remember whether this is an opt-in feature). I have since worked out that SpatialLite expects the coordinated to be the other way round: lon/lat and not lat/lon.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT ROWID, "PK_UID", "osm_id", "name", "type"
, Distance("Geometry" ,GeomFromText('POINT(-6.2626 53.34942)'))*100000 AS dist
FROM "points"
WHERE "type" = "hospital"
ORDER BY dist
</code></pre>

<p>gives me a result set starting with: osmid=641802162, name=Dublin Dental Hospital, distance 1289m</p>

<p>When I query the buildings I get: osmid=51776450, name=NULL, distance 261m…which is the first building of the Rotunda Maternity Hospital.</p>

<p>What I don't know is where to get hold of the area data. Is it in the road shapefile?! I think not. So where would it be?</p>

<ul>
  <li>as I am using Windows (not by choice, they made me do it!) I needed to download and install libspatialite, proj, geos and libiconv dlls from <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/binaries.html">http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/binaries.html</a></li>
  <li>I needed pysqlite for my python 2.5 installation from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pysqlite/downloads/list">http://code.google.com/p/pysqlite/downloads/list</a></li>
  <li>I also needed simplejson which I got via easy_install</li>
  <li>The script needed to point to the .dll and not an .so -self.db.execute("SELECT load_extension('libspatialite-1.dll')")</li>
  <li>
    <p>dict() doesn't like it when a key doesn't exist, so if there is an OSM node with no tags["name"] the program will error. Instead, I used defaultdict() with: from collections import defaultdict and self.tags = defaultdict(str)</p>

    <p>SELECT poi."id", tag."name", Distance("geom" ,GeomFromText('POINT(-6.2626 53.34942)'))*100000 AS dist, poi."name", "data"
  FROM "poi", "poitag", "tag"
  WHERE poi.id = poitag.poi
  AND poitag.tag = tag.id
  AND tag."value" = "cafe"
  ORDER BY dist</p>
  </li>
</ul>
