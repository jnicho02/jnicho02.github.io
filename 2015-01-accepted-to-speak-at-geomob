<p>​Oh, exciting! I've got my next speaking engagement. I will be talking at Geomob London about Open Plaques on 19 May.</p>

<p>I've been working on my public speaking skills for a while and have gone from nearly-being-sick-beforehand-God-when-is-this-over to this-feels-almost-like-it-could-be-fun.</p>

<p>I started with cozy 30-people tech talks and built up to talking at the TestBash 2014 Conference and the Open Data Institute Friday Lunchtime Lecture.</p>

<p>The 1-day course I did with Talking Ape was invaluable as I'm no longer held back by slide decks.</p>
