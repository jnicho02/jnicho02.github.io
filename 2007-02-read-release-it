<p>Just seen this book by Michael T. Nygard discussed in the JavaRanch Big Moose Saloon so I thought i'd make a note here to remember to look at it when it is released.</p>

<p>Michael appears to be covering a subject close to my heart. That of making software 'Production-Ready' and manageable in a live Production environment. If putting software live causes headaches then people won't want to, but releasing stuff should be our reason to live. The process needs to be as painless as possible so as to enable Developers to exercise their creative abilities in happiness.</p>
